intituion  : for ith round  , toggled every ith bulb  , means toggle muntiple of 
i,
notes all bulb except for the sqrt one get close , bcoz sqrt bulb dont dont have even pair 
for off on of bulb  ,
example : 5 
1 - on 
2 -on -off
3 - on -off
4 -on -off -on
5-on -off

so only 1 and 4 are on which are perfect square ;


class Solution {
public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
     return sqrt(n);
    }
};
