//for grid traversal using of row and col , no need to make adj matrix

// adjacent matrix is made when we have connection or link to get to other node 

//for dfs , traveral mostly use 4 recursivcall,
//for bfs , used delrow& delcol for traversal in 4 drn

//bfs and dajisktra algo(here source and destination is fixed) is use to find shortest distance
