question : there are few function we have to just maintain this function , 
visit - maintain the curr site that is visisted , 
back - store prev site that was visisted 
future  - store future site that can be visisted
NOTE : from curr site how to  travel to this function to access this functionality

intution : 
1. when ur visiting to a website  ,ur curr bcom past ,so it need to be store as backup
and future is cleared
2 . when move backward to access previous visted site  , 
storing curr in future bcoz it might get visted again in future store in future till step>0 and update curr with prev.top()  to maintain curr site 
3. when moving to future site, store curr in backup stack ,bcoz it might be visted  and do this till steps
and update the curr everytime with future top.



class BrowserHistory {
public:
stack<string>prev ;
stack<string>next;
string curr ;
    BrowserHistory(string homepage) {
         curr  = homepage;
    }
    
    void visit(string url) {
        
        prev.push(curr);
        curr = url;
        while(!next.empty()){
            next.pop();

        }
        
    }
    
    string back(int steps) {
        while(steps >0 && !prev.empty()){
            next.push(curr);
            curr = prev.top() ;
            prev.pop();
            steps--;

        }
        return curr;
        
    }
    
    string forward(int steps) {
        while(steps>0 && !next.empty()){
            prev.push(curr);
            curr = next.top();
            next.pop();
            steps--;
        }
        return curr;
        
    }
};
