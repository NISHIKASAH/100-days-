note1 : whenever question demand for all possible , then think of take 
not take with DS AND ANS datastructure usage.


note2 : when we have to iterate for new char for each iteration , then
i = 0 ,  and for next call idx+1 
if carrying the same chara  , then i = idx  then if it carry the same traits 
then i+1 or else idx+1.
