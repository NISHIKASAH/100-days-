question : minimum no of boat required to rescure all people,
1 boat can accomodate only 2 people with some limit

intution : since two and a limit is provide  ,think of two pointer after sorting array 

class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>&nums, int limit) {
        sort(nums.begin() , nums.end());
        int start= 0;
        int end=nums.size()-1;
        int count=0;
        while(start<=end){
            if(nums[start] + nums[end] <= limit){
                count++;
                start++;end--;
            }
           else{
            count++;
            end--;
           }

        }
        return count;
    }
};
